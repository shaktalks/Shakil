Math.floor()		//rounds the number down to the nearest whole number.

That's where variables come in. 
Variables allow us to assign data to a word and use the word to reference the data. 
If the data changes (like degrees Celsius) we can replace the variable's value instead of re-writing the program.

const, is short for constant which is a constant variable in javascript.

myName is the variable's name. 
Notice that the word has no spaces, and we capitalized the N. 
Capitalizing in this way is a standard convention in JavaScript called camelCasing, because the capital letters look like the humps on a camel's back.

The JavaScript term for inserting the data saved to a variable into a string is string interpolation.

The + operator, known until now as the addition operator, is used to interpolate (insert) a string variable into a string, as follows:

Backticks are amazing

the + operator is used to interpolate (combine) multiple strings.

In JavaScript ES6, backticks (`) and ${} are used to interpolate values into a string.

The core task of programming is writing lists of instructions for computers, or translating our ideas from human-speak to computer-speak.
